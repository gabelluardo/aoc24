# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024 with Deno ü¶ï

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) and [Deno](https://deno.com) solutions! I decided to tackle these holiday challenges with the coolest dinosaur around.

## Why Deno?

It's time to really understand where Deno and TypeScript stand in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Plus, I want to win those awesome stickers from the [official Deno AoC challenge](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024)!
